# Bundled fonts

Kechimochi ships its UI fonts instead of fetching them from the Google Fonts CDN at runtime, so the
app makes no third-party request to render its own interface.

Each file is the **latin subset, variable weight** build (`wght` axis, 100–900), which covers every
weight the UI uses in a single file. No italic build is bundled — italics are synthesised by the
browser, as they were before.

file, but the copyright notices differ, so every family carries its own copy as the OFL requires.
